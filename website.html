        <h2 id="about-me" class="outfit-bold about-me-head">About Me</h2>
        <p class = "outfit-normal about-me-text">I'm currently a sophomore attending the University of Delaware,
            <br>majoring in Computer Science (B.S.). I have experience coding in  
            <br>C++, C, Java, Python, Typescript, HTML, and CSS. I also work at
            <br>the university's IT support center during the school year where I 
            <br>assist those who need help troubleshooting their software 
            <br>related issues on their devices. 
            <br>    
            <br>I have participated in the annual hackathon hosted by my university  
            <br>where my team and I built a software that uses AI to detect potential  
            <br>medical illnesses. It uses the user's face and input they give on  
            <br>symptoms that aren't visible in an image such as being lightheaded. 
            <br>I have also volunteered at many places including the Montgomery County 
            <br>Agricultural Fair and the City of Rockville where I gained valuable 
            <br>experiences such as working as a team and communicating with others 
            <br>effectively.
            <br>
            <br>I am looking to be a software developer in the future with a strong 
            <br>interest in both frontend and backend development. I find it interesting 
            <br>how I can tackle real world problems by developing new software and I 
            <br>enjoy the process of designing the software. I will always be on the lookout 
            <br>for chances to improve and learn new skills.
