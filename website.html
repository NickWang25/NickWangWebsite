        <h2 id="about-me" class="outfit-bold about-me-head">About Me</h2>
        <p class = "outfit-normal about-me-text">I'm currently a sophomore attending the University of Delaware. I have experience coding in
            <br>C++, C, Java, Python, Typescript, HTML, and CSS. I also work at the university's IT support center 
            <br>during the school year where I assist those who need help troubleshooting their software  
            <br>related issues on their devices. 
            <br>    
            <br>I have participated in the annual hackathon hosted by my university where my team and I built 
            <br>a software that uses AI to detect potential medical illnesses. It uses the user's face and 
            <br>input they give on symptoms that aren't visible in an image such as being lightheaded. I have 
            <br>also volunteered at many places including the Montgomery County Agricultural Fair and the City  
            <br>of Rockville where I gained valuable experiences such as working as a team and communicating 
            <br>with others effectively.
            <br>
            <br>I am looking to be a software developer in the future with a strong interest in both frontend 
            <br>and backend development. I find it interesting how I can tackle real world problems by 
            <br>developing new software and I enjoy the process of designing the software. I will always be 
            <br>on the lookout for chances to improve and learn new skills.
